# Data Structures Conclusion

## Learning Goals

- Review what you learned in this section

## Recap

In this section, you learned many common data structures, including:

- Sets
- Stacks
- Linked Lists
- Trees

For each of these data structures, you learned how to **implement common
methods**, **identify the runtime using Big O notation**, and how to **evaluate
the tradeoffs** of choosing one data structure over another.

By gaining experience with these common data structures, you should have an
easier time learning some other common data structures in the future. The best
thing to do from here is practice! It's important to see more problems like the
ones you've worked on in this section, so that you can start identifying
patterns and build up an intuition for determining which data structures will
help with different kinds of problems. Check out the resources section for some
ways to continue building your skills.

## Resources

- [LeetCode Problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)
  - These problems are organized by difficulty and are searchable. Start with
    easy problems and work your way up — the medium and hard problems are quite
    challenging! It can be helpful to search using the 'Tags' feature to search
    for several problems that use the same data structure to get some reps and
    identify patterns.
  - [FIS DSA 100+](https://leetcode.com/list/5r99deem/) is a curated list of
    over 100 LeetCode problems chosen by Flatiron School.
  - [LeetCode Patterns](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/) is a site
    that lets you browse LeetCode problems grouped by patterns, so you can work
    on spotting common patterns to problems through repetition.
- [HackerRank Interview Prep Kit](https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/interview-preparation-kit)
  has groups of challenges by common patterns and data structures for practice.
- [Tech Interview Handbook](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/) has curated
  interview prep materials, including
  [algorithm material](https://techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/introduction/)
  that has example questions for different data structures.
- [BaseCS](https://medium.com/basecs/tagged/data-structures) is a blog devoted
  to the basics of computer science with great visuals.
